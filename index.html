                            <p>Darkside's debut album Psychic was released on October 4, 2013. The album was recorded
                                over the course of two years between Jaar's home in New York City, Harrington's family
                                barn in Upstate New York, and a space in Paris where they would stay between tours. The
                                band announced the album's completion on August 20, 2013, with Jaar and Harrington
                                inviting fans via Facebook and Twitter to listen to the album with them at a small venue
                                on New York's Lower East Side. The band had to do two listening sessions to accommodate
                                all of the people who showed up.</p>
